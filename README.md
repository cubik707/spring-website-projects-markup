# Projects Page Clone
This repository contains a project where I recreated the "Projects" page from the official Spring website. The main focus of this project was on HTML/CSS layout and adding native JavaScript for dynamic functionality, such as loading projects and interactive header elements.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Responsive Layout: Built with semantic HTML and CSS, ensuring a fully responsive design across various devices.
- Native JavaScript: No frameworks or libraries, just pure JavaScript for:
- Dynamically loading project content.
- Interactive header behavior (e.g., sticky navigation, dropdown menus).

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project?
This project was developed to strengthen my skills in front-end layout and native JavaScript by focusing on:

- Crafting a pixel-perfect layout based on a professional design.
- Understanding how to create interactive UI elements without relying on frameworks.
- Learning to manage and manipulate the DOM dynamically with vanilla JavaScript.
